# theSpaceMan
A simple Computer Graphics game project about a space man who wants to get to is ship. 

                                            
                                            
                                            
                                              Project Design
  
  
  Platform:
   
   -The platform that I’m going to use is Unity for the reason that it’s a good platform for creating and developing games.
   
  Idea:
    
    - In this course I will implement a simple game like space invaders or a 2D endless run type of game, 
      just because these games are very simple and not very hard to learn. 
      It will be my first project in Unity so I want a simpler project to work on.

    - The idea is to work with 2d objects and with that create a modest game.
    
    - For the 2d endless run game we start to create a background scenario for the environment of the game.
      With that we create a simple 2d character that will be able to move in the scenario. 
      After all that we start to build the objects (geometric objects) to generate some entertaining to the game.
      
    - I´m also interested in creating a first person scenario. 
      The main goal is to create an environment in 3D that a 3D character can explore on,
      involving the book by Dr. Spencer Johnson “Who moved my Cheese”.
